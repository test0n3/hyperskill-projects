# The Phone Call

A series of pops, fizzles and crackles in the air ended in a blinding light from which you instinctively shielded your eyes. Still not seeing anything, you felt a heavy hand on your shoulder.

"Thank you" said a now familiar voice.

You opened your eyes and saw the owl-man in front of you. It was the first time you got to look at him from head to toe. A hunched person in a retro tuxedo and green boots that did not fit his look. Well, not to mention the owl mask which would outshine even the most bizarre footwear.

"You found me and, as I promised, I will help you. You need to make a call? But of course! But uh... You see," said the owl man in an apologetic tone, walking you to a very peculiar device "my phone's input is in binary. Moreover, it accepts only 32 inputs at once on the dial, so if your phone number is larger than that... You will have to improvise."

You picked up a handset shaped as a lobster (for some reason) and stared at the rotary dial with only two digits: 0 and 1. Under the disk, a pale grey button overflow stood out.

> You will receive a decimal phone number as your dataset. Respond with a number of overflows and a 32-bit binary unsigned integer in that order, divided by a single comma. If the decimal is too big to fit in the 32-bit binary, increase the number of overflows and subtract decimal value at which overflow occurs from the phone number. Then try to convert it again, until it does not overflow. If the binary has any leading zeroes, remove them.
