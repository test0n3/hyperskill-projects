# Let's do the... Runtime Warp again??

A heavy key fell from a secret compartment in the chandelier. You surprised yourself by catching it.

The key entered the door's lock very easily, and you entered a ballroom of such size, that you questioned whether you were still in the same mansion. Surely it was not possible for something this big to fit in the building you'd seen from the outside. While the ballroom was packed with bottles, confetti and even still hot snacks, nobody was present. What happened to so many people in such a short amount of time? You have not heard any music or voices even when you entered the mansion.

Suddenly a dozen of speakers attached to the walls crackled all together. You started hearing a familiar voice of the man in the owl mask.

"I knew you could make it this far. Everything will be revealed to you soon. And all your requests will be fulfilled. Don't worry about that." The voice actually sounded more lively than the last time. You were even somewhat happy to hear it after the complete silence of the previous rooms. "Now, there is just one problem. You see, I am stuck in sort of a time loop. Let me tell you how it works..."

The man explained his unbelievably sci-fi condition for half an hour straight. Tachyons, chronitons, Planck particles... The gist of it was that the owl-man wanted you to calculate the distances between some coordinates in four-dimensional space and tell him an approximate distance he will have to travel to exit the time loop.

> You will receive a list of four-dimensional vectors, where each vector consists of four integers. Your goal is to calculate the total distance traveled through these vectors in sequence:
> 1. Calculate the Euclidean distance between each consecutive pair of vectors (first to second, second to third, third to fourth, etc.).
> 2. If any distance is not a whole number, round it up to the nearest integer.
> 3. Add all the rounded up distances together to get your final answer.

> You can use the Euclidean distance formula for 4D vectors.
