# The Good(?) Ending

Your hands trembled as you fumbled with the keys, the old engine coughing before it finally roared to life. Through the cracked windshield, you saw the mansion begin to sink into itself, timbers shrieking, windows shattering like screams trapped in glass. You slammed your foot on the pedal, the tires tearing through the gravel as the whole world behind you seemed to collapse into a writhing pit of shadow and dust. The echoes of owl-man's cry followed you down the winding road until even the night swallowed them whole.

For a long time, you just drove. The forest pressed close on either side, your headlights slicing through the mist in thin, trembling lines. Regret gnawed at you with every mile. You told yourself there had been no choice, that you had only done what he'd asked. But still...

When you finally pulled over, the silence was unbearable. The night air was cold and heavy, smelling faintly of ash and iron. You opened the glove compartment, searching for something, maybe a phone or some cash, and your breath caught. There, resting neatly on top of the papers, was a folded piece of parchment. Your name was written across it in jagged, ink-black strokes.

You unfolded it and chuckled. Of course, yet another puzzle. The instruction read:

```
There are 16 letters on each line. 8 left and 8 right. 14 of them, 7 left and 7 right, have an exact pair.
2 of them, on each side, do not. Your answer is the pairless letters.
```

As the first lights of the morning sun fell on your face through the windshield, you started writing code one last time.

> Example dataset:

`HVbNpDBmBNDVbmHi`

> The answer here would be pi, since p and i are the two letters without pairs. Notice that lowercase and uppercase letters are treated as different letters.

> To get data for this task, click "Download the dataset".

> You will need to submit only the right answer as plain text. You can write and run code in IDE of your choice or use our code playground (click on the Spacebot at the bottom right).

> If you feel stuck, join our Discord community and ask for hints in a special channel #fright-night-coding.
