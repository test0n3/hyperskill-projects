# The Game Begins

The antenna made a squeaking sound when you set it into a proper position. The static noise slowly faded and a picture appeared on the screen. You felt immobilized with fear when you noticed a man in a bizarre owl mask looking right at you from the TV. You heard a distorted voice:

> "Hello. Do you want to play a game?"

The figure paused for a couple of seconds, which for you felt like an eternity.

> "Just kidding. Always wanted to do that". A dry, crackling sound followed. Only later did you realize that the owl-man was laughing. "I am the master of this mansion. If you are here, I assume you need some help?"

You started explaining the whole flat tire situation ramblingly, until the mask suddenly spoke again.

> "Did you really start answering the question? You doofus, this is a recording. Isn't it obvious? Whatever your problem is, I can help. But first, you need to find me. It's easy, if you're smart enough."

The figure faded and a set of instructions appeared on the screen:

```
The clue is in unique letters
```

Some nonsensical text was placed below. What could that possibly mean?
