# The Piano Puzzle

After you carefully input the last letter in the keypad, the whole room started shaking as if some random earthquake localized entirely within the kitchen happened. You quickly realized that the room with you inside it somehow was slowly spinning. After about a minute it finally stopped, and the only doorway now led not to the hallway you came here from, but to a completely new room.

While the other parts of the mansion you've seen so far were old and falling apart, this chamber looked like it was not touched by time. A golden chandelier was hanging from the ceiling, the walls appeared freshly painted in red and green, and even the dust which followed you everywhere up to this point has disappeared. Huge baroque windows decorated wall on the right. In front of you were enormous doors leading to the next space. Locked, of course.

At the center of the room was a grand piano. Its black lacquer shimmered in the chandelier light. When you looked closer at the sheet music on the rack, you realized, that it was just yet another note with instructions.

```
You are doing well so far. Hang in there. This piano is special. 
I retrieved it from some abandoned school. You see, it had some stupid bird-related puzzle attached to it. I got rid of all that boring stuff, and reprogrammed it to use another sequence. Your clue is on the other side of this note. Find the shortest sequence that contains all 7 notes, and play it to get the key.
```

Finding the shortest sequence in a huge amount of data. You felt grateful that you'd spent several months studying on Hyperskill before. The task sounds harder than it really is. Once again, you picked up your trusted laptop.

> The seven notes are A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

> For example, with the following dataset: `ADCEEFAGABDC` the answer would be `EFAGABDC`, since it has all 7 notes in it and it's the shortest sequence like that.

> In the case of several sequences of the same length, you will need to choose the one that appears in the dataset first.


> To get data for this task, click "Download the dataset".

> You will need to submit only the right answer as plain text. You can write and run code in IDE of your choice or use our code playground (click on the Spacebot at the bottom right).

> If you feel stuck, join our Discord community and ask for hints in a special channel #fright-night-coding.
