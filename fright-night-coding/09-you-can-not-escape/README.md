# You Can (not) Escape

As you pronounced the tongue-twisting demon names, they comically popped out of existence with a sound like you'd never heard before. As your laptop processed data from the grimoire, the ranks of horrors grew thinner and thinner, until only one remained. A mass of writhing tentacles framed a head both alien and divine, and vast wings, ancient and decayed, unfurled as if to blot out the Universe.

"This is a new one. Kid, you are clearly not fit for this party. Leave me to deal with this being. Run away!" shouted the owl-man. "Here, take this."

He threw you a map of the mansion that would help you to reach the garage and his car keys. If only everything were that simple. The map is written in a vanishing ink! It would disappear in a couple of minutes. You certainly could not memorize it so fast. What you could do is use your laptop to calculate the shortest path to the garage!

Trying not to pay attention to chilling screams and the sounds of an epic battle behind your back, you started working.

> In this task, you will receive a map of the mansion as a dataset. `#` represents walls, `.` represents walkable floor, `P` represents your starting point and `G` represents the garage. Your answer should be the shortest path in a format like the following: `UDLRRLDU`, where `U` is moving Up, `D` is moving Down, `L` is moving Left and `R` is moving Right.

> Some layouts may have multiple shortest paths, any of them should be accepted.


> To get data for this task, click "Download the dataset".

> You will need to submit only the right answer as plain text. You can write and run code in IDE of your choice or use our code playground (click on the Spacebot at the bottom right).

> If you feel stuck, join our Discord community and ask for hints in a special channel #fright-night-coding.
